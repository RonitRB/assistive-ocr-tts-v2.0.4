# Assistive Technology for Visually Impaired Students (NAIN 2.0)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **Assistive Technology System for Visually Impaired Students** that enables real-time auditory access to classroom board content. The system captures text written on classroom boards (blackboard, whiteboard, or projected digital content), converts it into readable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and then converts the text into speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

The spoken output is delivered wirelessly to the student through a Bluetooth audio device (earbuds or headphones), allowing visually impaired students to follow classroom teaching independently and in real time.

This project is developed under **NAIN 2.0**, a Karnataka State Government–funded innovation initiative.

## Problem Statement

Visually impaired students often depend on:

- Human assistance
- Post-class notes
- Limited accessibility tools

These methods do not provide **real-time access** to what teachers write on classroom boards. Existing OCR tools are mostly document-based or mobile-dependent and are not optimized for live classroom environments.

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed system introduces a **real-time classroom OCR-to-TTS pipeline** using edge AI.

### System Workflow

1. A high-resolution camera captures live images of the classroom board.
2. Images are processed locally on a Jetson Orin Nano.
3. OCR algorithms extract handwritten and digital text.
4. Extracted text is converted into speech using TTS.
5. Audio output is transmitted to the student via Bluetooth earbuds/headphones.
